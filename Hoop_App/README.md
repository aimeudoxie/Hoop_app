    Hoop Parking App
Description: 

The Hoop Parking App is a convenient solution designed to help users find the nearest parking spots for their vehicles within a specific region. Whether you're driving a car, motorcycle, or bicycle, Hoop provides an efficient way to locate available parking spaces, saving you time and reducing the hassle of searching for parking.

Motivation: 

The motivation behind developing the Hoop Parking App stemmed from the increasing challenges faced by drivers when trying to find suitable parking spots, especially in busy urban areas. We recognized the need for a user-friendly and efficient solution to alleviate the stress and frustration associated with parking, thus enhancing the overall driving experience.

Purpose:

The primary objective of the Hoop Parking App is to streamline the parking process for users by offering real-time information on available parking spaces in their vicinity. By leveraging technology, the app aims to simplify the task of parking, enabling users to quickly locate suitable spots for their vehicles without unnecessary delays or complications.

Key Features:

Vehicle-Specific Parking: Users can specify the type of vehicle they are driving (car, motorcycle, bicycle) to find parking spaces tailored to their needs.
Real-Time Updates: The app provides up-to-date information on parking availability, including the number of spots available and their locations.
Navigation Integration: Seamlessly integrates with navigation apps to provide directions to selected parking spots, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free parking experience.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, the app offers an intuitive interface that allows users to quickly navigate and access the information they need.
What We Learned
During the development of the Hoop Parking App, we gained valuable insights into the complexities of parking management and the importance of efficient navigation solutions. Additionally, we honed our skills in user interface design, real-time data integration, and optimizing user experiences in mobile applications.

Future Enhancements:
